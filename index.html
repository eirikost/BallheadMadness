    <h1>Privacy Policy - Ballhead Madness</h1>
    <p>Osteby built the <strong>Ballhead Madness</strong> app as a free app with ads and optional multiplayer features. This SERVICE is provided by Osteby at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
    <p>This page explains the policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of data when you use the app. By using the app, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>Log Data</h2>
    <p>The app relies on third-party services, such as Unity and Google, to collect diagnostic and crash data. This may include details like your device type, operating system, and app performance. This information is used solely to improve the app and resolve issues.</p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>This app does not use cookies directly. However, third-party services integrated into the app may use cookies to enhance their functionality. Please review their respective privacy policies for more details.</p>

    <h2>Service Providers</h2>

These services may collect data to perform their tasks and improve the app's features. However, they are bound by their privacy policies to handle your data securely and responsibly.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Your trust is important to me. While I do not collect personal information directly, I ensure that third-party services integrated into the app are reputable and take appropriate measures to secure your data. However, no method of transmission over the internet is completely secure, and absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</p>

    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>The app may include links to third-party websites. If you click on these links, you will be redirected to external sites that are not operated by me. I recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these websites, as I am not responsible for their practices or content.</p>

    <p>This app is not intended for children under the age of 13, and I do not knowingly collect data from children. If I discover that a child under 13 has provided personal information to one of the integrated third-party services, I will take immediate action to ensure the data is deleted. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided data, please contact me.</p>
